## Project Descreption
This project is a fully complete functional project having the static HTML & CSS files along with the recently added javaScript, all together combined to result in this final look of our Landing Page with multi-section navigation bar that is dynamically updated with each new section added to the HTML, moreover with clicking on each navigation bar list item will scroll us to the appropriate section in such a smooth way of scrolling. 

## Usage
You can use this project eaisly after downlodaing it by navigating project folders and files and open them using editor, there is a css folder having the styles.css file, a js folder having app.js file, and lastly the file of HTML as index.html. 

## Installation
you can install this project either by:
* clonning the remote repository to your local machine so that you can follow along. To clone, you can use `(git clone https://github.com/MarianWadia/Udacity-Landing-page.git)` command on your terminal. When you clone a remote repository, you get an identical copy locally, where you can make desired changes.
* Fork the remote repository to your own online account. When you fork a remote repository, a new duplicate copy of the remote repository is created in your account.

## Project Dependencies
If there is any change that may be applied to the HTML file maybe a class names or ids or something else, make sure to check if it should be changed in both css and javaScript files as well, as all the three files HTML, CSS, javaScript are dependent on each other in most of the items.

## Development
Mainly the javaScript dynamic features are added in this stage of the project development. The dynamic multi-section navigation bar, the focus state added to each section in the user's viewPort moreover the collapsible state of each section that is already collapsed by default and whenever clicked the section content will be displayed automatically. 
There are other two more features added through this stage, the Scroll To Top button at the end of the page appearing when the user scrolls below the fold of the page using the `element.scrollIntoView({behaviour: "smooth", block:"end"},false)`, if it is clicked will return us back to the top of the page.
The last feature in this stage is the static state of the navigation bar while the user is not scrolling, that state will be converted to its fixed position by scrolling the page.
